## Construction and Installation

To get a production build of the software, go the [latest `master` CI run](https://github.com/CosmoQuestX/CSB7.0/actions?query=branch%3Amaster) and download the `csb-build` artifact.

### Step 1: Setup the Server

#### 1.1 Setup LAMP Server

Setup an Apache 2 / MySQL 8 / PHP 7 environment. If we don't have specific instructions you need below, look for
instructions for Wordpress. Our setup should be the same.

* OSX
    * Enable Apache `apachectl start`
    * In `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`
        * Uncomment `LoadModule` statements for php7 and mod_rewrite _Use Legacy Password Encryption_
        * Set `AllowOverride All`
    * Restart Apache `sudo apachectl restart`
    * [Install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql)
    * Add mysql to your `.bash_profile` by adding `export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"`
- Ubuntu: find the Digital Ocean Tutorial for your version of Ubuntu
- Windows: _to be determined_

If you don't have a LAMP (or Win AMP) setup, find instructions to install
Wordpress. This software requires the same kind of server configuration!
For ubuntu, the Digital Ocean tutorials are among the best.


#### 1.2 Add SASS support
To install SASS, follow instructions on https://sass-lang.com/install. Once things
are installed, you'll need to compile your sass files into css files whenever
the sass is edited.

To watch and compile sass on the command line run:
```shell
sass --watch csb-themes/default/sass/style.scss:csb-themes/default/style.css
```

PHPstorm can watch and compile sass (see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html).

Instructions on compiling SASS in ubuntu are here: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/watch-and-compile-sass-in-five-quick-steps--cms-28275

#### 1.3 If you can, add a security certificate
You should always use a certificate. If you don't have one, try using the free
[Let's Encrypt: CertBot](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).

#### 1.4 Going to email folks? Add PEAR
macOS Mojave use https://tobschall.de/2018/08/07/pear-on-mojave/
General installation use https://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php

### Step 2: Launch the installer
Go to http://yourhost/csb-installer/ in your browser.
  This will let you configure your installation and then install databases and setup an admin user using the settings in csb-settings.php

### Optional - Using Docker

#### 1. Install Docker Desktop for your platform
Download and install the corresponding docker desktop version for your OS from [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community)

#### 2. Build and Start CSB
For Windows - open either Command Console or Powershell\
For Mac or Linux - open your command shell

Execute the following command from the CSB directory:
```docker-compose up```

To stop docker and close the app, press Ctrl+C

#### 3. Launch the installer
Go to http://localhost:8080/csb/csb-installer/ in your browser. 
  To use the docker MariaDB, use ```db``` as your database hostname
  Default docker username, password, and database are all ```csb```
